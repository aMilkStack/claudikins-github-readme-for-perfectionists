# The Think-Tank

**Goal:** Extract high-converting patterns from similar tools and identify "Anti-Patterns" to avoid.

## Step 1: Load Research Standards

Read the governance files:
1. `references/scoring-rubric.md` (How to grade quality).
2. `references/badge-ecosystem.md` (Which badges signal what).
3. `references/gemini-deep-research.md` (How to execute Gemini deep research).

---

## Step 2: Define Search Criteria

Based on project context from codebase analysis, match on:

| Criterion | How to Match |
|-----------|--------------|
| Category | Same project type (CLI, library, framework, API, etc.) |
| Tech Stack | Same or similar languages/frameworks |
| Ecosystem | Same package manager (npm, PyPI, Cargo) |
| Complexity | Similar scope (simple util vs enterprise tool) |
| Maturity | Established projects with proven documentation |

**Search queries:**
```
"best [project-type] [tech-stack] github"
"awesome [technology] list"
"[similar-tool] alternatives github"
```

Find 10-15 candidates, then narrow to top 5-7 based on stars and initial quality scan.

---

## Step 3: Score Each README

Rate each README 1-10 on these dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What to Look For |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Value Proposition | 20% | Problem and solution crystal clear in first paragraph |
| Time to Joy (TTJ) | 20% | Commands to first working result (target: 2-3) |
| Visual Quality | 15% | GIFs, diagrams, code blocks, dark mode support |
| Structure | 15% | Logical flow, scannable, TOC if >200 lines |
| SEO Signals | 10% | Keywords in title, semantic headers, topics tagged |
| Badge Quality | 10% | Informative badges, 5-7 max, consistent style |
| Maintenance Signals | 10% | Recent commits, active issues, working links |

### Quantitative Targets

| Metric | Good | Red Flag |
|--------|------|----------|
| Flesch-Kincaid Grade | 8-10 | >12 (too complex) |
| TTJ (commands to result) | 2-3 | >5 |
| Visual Density | 1 per 300 words | >600 words without visual |
| Badge Count | 5-7 | >10 or 0 |

### The "Slop" Penalty

**CRITICAL:** Scan the text for the "Delve Index" (Delve, Seamless, Tapestry, Unleash, Landscape).
- **Action:** If *any* appear in the Description/Intro, **DEDUCT 2 POINTS**.
- *Rationale:* We do not want to mimic popular-but-lazy documentation.

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Exemplary - study closely |
| 7-8 | High quality - good patterns |
| 5-6 | Average - selective borrowing |
| 3-4 | Below average - learn what not to do |

---

## Step 4: Pattern Extraction

For each high-scoring exemplar, extract:

**Hero Section:**
- Banner/logo style
- Tagline approach
- Badge selection and arrangement

**Structure:**
- Section order and naming conventions
- Use of collapsible sections
- Table of Contents style

**Visuals:**
- GIF usage (terminal recordings, UI demos)
- Diagram types (architecture, flow)
- Screenshot placement

**Writing Style:**
- Tone (minimal, conversational, opinionated, reference)
- Code example density
- Explanation depth

## Step 5: Badge Recommendations

### Badge Categories by Signal

| Category | Signal | When to Use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Build Status | "Code compiles and tests pass" | Always |
| Code Coverage | "Maintainers care about testing" | If coverage >60% |
| Version | "This is a releasable product" | If published to registry |
| Social Proof | "Crowd has vetted this" | Only if numbers impress (5000+ stars) |
| License | "Legal to use in my project" | Always |
| Activity | "Project is alive" | Only if actively maintained |

### Badge Styles

Pick ONE style across all badges:
- `flat` - Modern, clean (most projects)
- `flat-square` - Sharp edges (technical projects)
- `for-the-badge` - Large, bold (hero sections only)

### Recommended Badge Sets

**Minimal (3-4):** Build Status, Version, License

**Standard (5-6):** Build Status, Coverage, Version, Downloads, License

**Comprehensive (7 max):** Build Status, Coverage, Quality, Version, Downloads, License, Last Commit

### Badge Anti-Patterns

- **Overload:** 15+ badges creating visual chaos
- **Inconsistent styling:** Mix of flat, plastic, for-the-badge
- **Vanity badges:** "Made with JavaScript" adds no value
- **Stale badges:** Coverage showing 0% from broken CI
- **Meaningless numbers:** Badging 3 stars, 12 downloads

## Step 6: Section Recommendations

| Section | When to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| Quick Start | Always - first thing after hero |
| Installation | Always - multiple methods if applicable |
| Usage/Examples | Always - show, don't just tell |
| API Reference | Libraries and frameworks |
| Configuration | If configurable |
| Architecture | Complex projects with multiple components |
| Contributing | Open source projects seeking contributions |
| FAQ | If common questions exist |
| Troubleshooting | If known gotchas exist |

## Output Format

```markdown
# Think-Tank Research Results

## Summary
- **Repos Analysed:** [X]
- **High Quality (8-10):** [X]
- **Key Patterns Identified:** [X]

## Top Exemplar: [Repo Name]
- **Score:** [X]/10 (Slop Penalty: [Yes/No])
- **Why it wins:** [specific reason]
- **Steal this:** [specific pattern]

## The Blueprint (Our Plan)

### 1. Visual Strategy
- **Hero:** [e.g., Terminal GIF using VHS]
- **Architecture:** [e.g., Mermaid Graph LR]
- **Density Target:** One visual every [X] words.

### 2. Badge Selection
*(Selected from references/badge-ecosystem.md)*
- [Badge 1]: [what it signals]
- [Badge 2]: [what it signals]
- [Badge 3]: [what it signals]

### 3. Structural Flow
1. Hero & Badges

```

## Handoff

**Ask:** "Research complete. We have the Badge list, Visual strategy, and Structural plan. Ready to wield the pen?"
- If refine -> more research
- If continue -> Use `pen-wielding`
